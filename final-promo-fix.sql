-- FINAL FIX: Ensure per-user promotion limits are working correctly
-- This script removes all global usage limit logic and ensures proper per-user validation

-- 1. Drop any existing record_promotion_usage function variants
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS record_promotion_usage(UUID, UUID, UUID);

-- 2. Create the CORRECT record_promotion_usage function with per-user validation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION record_promotion_usage(
    p_promotion_id UUID,
    p_user_id UUID,
    p_order_id UUID
) RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    current_user_usage_count INTEGER;
    promotion_usage_limit INTEGER;
BEGIN
    -- Get the promotion's usage limit
    SELECT usage_limit INTO promotion_usage_limit 
    FROM promotions 
    WHERE id = p_promotion_id;

    -- Count how many times this user has used this promotion
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO current_user_usage_count
    FROM promotion_usage 
    WHERE promotion_id = p_promotion_id 
    AND user_id = p_user_id;

    -- Check if user has reached their personal limit
    IF current_user_usage_count >= promotion_usage_limit THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'User has already used this promotion code % time(s) (limit: %)', 
            current_user_usage_count, promotion_usage_limit;
        RETURN;
    END IF;

    -- Record the usage
    INSERT INTO promotion_usage (
        promotion_id,
        user_id,
        order_id,
        used_at
    ) VALUES (
        p_promotion_id,
        p_user_id,
        p_order_id,
        NOW()
    );

    -- Update the global times_used counter (total usage count across all users)
    UPDATE promotions 
    SET times_used = times_used + 1
    WHERE id = p_promotion_id;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Promotion usage recorded for user % and promotion % (usage: %/%)', 
        p_user_id, p_promotion_id, current_user_usage_count + 1, promotion_usage_limit;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- 3. Grant necessary permissions
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION record_promotion_usage TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION record_promotion_usage TO anon;

-- 4. Test the system by showing current state
SELECT 
    'CURRENT PROMOTIONS STATUS' as info,
    code, 
    description, 
    usage_limit as per_user_limit,
    times_used as total_uses_all_users,
    is_active,
    CASE 
        WHEN NOW() < valid_from THEN 'Not started'
        WHEN NOW() > valid_until THEN 'Expired'
        WHEN NOT is_active THEN 'Inactive'
        ELSE 'Active'
    END as status
FROM promotions 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- 5. Show explanation
SELECT 
    '=== PROMOTION SYSTEM NOW WORKS AS FOLLOWS ===' as explanation,
    'usage_limit = how many times EACH USER can use the code' as rule1,
    'times_used = total uses across ALL USERS' as rule2,
    'No more global usage limits!' as rule3,
    'Each user gets their own allowance based on usage_limit' as rule4;

-- 6. Test a promotion if one exists (will show proper error handling)
DO $$
DECLARE
    test_promo_id UUID;
    test_user_id UUID;
BEGIN
    -- Get a test promotion and user
    SELECT id INTO test_promo_id FROM promotions WHERE is_active = true LIMIT 1;
    SELECT id INTO test_user_id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1;
    
    IF test_promo_id IS NOT NULL AND test_user_id IS NOT NULL THEN
        RAISE NOTICE '';
        RAISE NOTICE 'üß™ TESTING: Function is ready to handle per-user validation';
        RAISE NOTICE 'Next time a user applies a promo code, it will check ONLY their personal usage';
        RAISE NOTICE '';
    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE '‚ö†Ô∏è No test data available - but function is correctly installed';
    END IF;
END $$;

SELECT 'SUCCESS: Per-user promotion limits are now properly configured!' as result;
